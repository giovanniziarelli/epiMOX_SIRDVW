# Optimal control problems on a SIRDVW model for the SARS-CoV-2 on the vaccination campaign: epiMOX Research group

The following code has been developed for optimizing vaccination campaigns on a SIRDVW age-stratified model, conceived with SARS-CoV-2 transmission mechanism and with the Italian Vaccination Campaign. Details of the model can be found in .
This code has been developed from the epiMOX research group at Politecnico di Milano (Milan, Italy) at MOX laboratory for Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing.

The repository is organized as follows:
