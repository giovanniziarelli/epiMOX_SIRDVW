# Optimal control problems on a SIRDVW model for the SARS-CoV-2 on the vaccination campaign: epiMOX Research group

The following code has been developed for optimizing vaccination campaigns on a SIRDVW age-stratified model, conceived with SARS-CoV-2 transmission mechanism and with the Italian Vaccination Campaign. Details of the model can be found in .
This code has been developed from the epiMOX research group at Politecnico di Milano (Milan, Italy) at MOX laboratory for Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing.
